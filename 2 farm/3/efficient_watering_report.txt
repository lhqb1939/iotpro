This report simulates fixed water input (e.g., pump time in seconds) and its effect on soil moisture readings.

**Average decrease in sensor reading per second of watering**: 20.33

This value can be used in the server code to estimate how long the pump should run to reach a target soil moisture level.
For example, if the desired decrease is 60 units, the pump should run for approximately 2.95 seconds.
